# projectAssignment

I created this project while studying up on React.

A friend/mentor of mine asked me to create this as an assignment, where I have to use this fake API call which fetches some data.
I have to use it in React components :)
Simple app. but i didnt want my work go wasted.

Please dont judge :)..If you do also, I will still love you ..  ❤️❤️❤️
